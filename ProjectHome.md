MagickTiler is a Java library and utility for converting image files into formats suitable for publishing them as high-resolution, zoomable Web images.

MagickTiler also includes options for batch processing and quality control, supports a wide range of image input formats and the following output formats:
  * TMS tileset
  * Zoomify tileset
  * Google Maps tileset
  * Pyramid TIFF (PTIF)

Take a look at our [slides](http://slidesha.re/h4OKfF) for a detailed explanation of the supported tiling schemes.

MagickTiler uses GraphicsMagick to perform image manipulation (resizing, cropping, etc.) Therefore, you must also install GraphicsMagick from [http://www.graphicsmagick.org/](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) before using MagickTiler.
